      <p>
        The term "wild card" is best known in international sports in reference to team wildcards in the Olympic Games and individual wildcards in tennis tournaments. In the Olympics, countries that fail to meet qualification standards are granted wildcards, allowing them to enter competitors with proven abilities below the standard. In tennis, wildcards are given to players who want to enter a tournament on short notice.

        Wildcard winners in Olympic and World Championship competitions include Kye Sun-Hui (judo, 1996), Ding Junhui (snooker, 2005), Goran Ivanišević (tennis, 2001), Kim Clijsters (tennis, 2009), and Lin Dan (badminton, 2013).

      <h2>North America</h2>
      <p>
        In North American professional sports leagues, "wild card" refers to a team that qualifies for the championship playoffs without winning their conference or division outright. The rules vary, but wild card teams usually have the best records among teams that did not win their divisions and often play the majority of their postseason games away from home.

        Examples of non-wild card playoff formats include the American Football League's 1969 playoffs, the National Basketball Association's 1967-1970 and 1971-1972 playoffs, and the National Hockey League's 1968-1974 and 1982-1993 playoffs.
